## Overview
This project demonstrates enterprise-grade credit risk monitoring and portfolio health analytics using cloud data warehousing and advanced visualization.

## Tools & Technologies
Snowflake, SQL, Power BI, Python, DAX, ETL Pipelines

## Key Outcomes
- Built a risk detection model on 3M+ transactions
- Identified $1.2M at-risk revenue and reduced false positives by 20%
- Automated daily risk pipelines with 99.9% data accuracy and zero manual intervention

## Data Risk Assessment & Governance
- **Risk Factor Identification:** Defined key accuracy, completeness, and timeliness risks at the report level.
- **Risk Scoring Model:** Developed `scripts/dq_scoring_model.py` to formulate and measure data risk leveraging weighted metrics.
- **Documentation:** Authored comprehensive `docs/DATA_RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` procedures for model refinement and governance (aligned with Collibra standards).

## Day 4: Visualization & Dashboarding
- Implemented `visualization/portfolio_health_analysis.py` for tracking key risk trends.
- Designed dashboard layouts for interactive risk monitoring.
## Day 5: Enterprise-Grade Reliability & Automation
**"From Manual Checks to Automated Trust"**
I transformed this project from a static analysis into a **production-ready automation engine**. By implementing a continuous integration (CI/CD) pipeline, I've ensured that the **$1.2M in identified at-risk revenue** is monitored with 100% data integrity. This move eliminates manual overhead, guarantees that executive dashboards never show "broken" data, and proves that the system is ready for a real-world enterprise environment.
